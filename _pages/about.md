# üßë‚Äçüíª About Me

I am an Research Assistant Professor of [Institute for Network Sciences and Cyberspace](https://www.insc.tsinghua.edu.cn), Tsinghua University. My research focuses on enhancing the security of critical network infrastructures. I am broadly interested in network security, cellular system security, and data-driven approaches to security. My recent work investigates security vulnerabilities in 4G/5G cellular networks and the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). Prior to my current position, I was a postdoctoral fellow at Tsinghua University from 2022 to 2024, co-advised by Professor [Haixin Duan](https://netsec.ccert.edu.cn/people/duanhx/). I received my Doctoral degree in Computer Science and Technology at Tsinghua in 2022, and my Bachelor degree in Fundamental Science of Mathematics and Physics at Tsinghua in 2017.

üì£ **Hiring: our group is continuously looking for highly motivated PhD/Master/undergraduate students and research interns, please free to reach out via email (zhangyiming@tsinghua.edu.cn)**. 

I also welcome academic collaborations in any form‚Äîplease don‚Äôt hesitate to get in touch.
